                    <p>
                        Calico cats have an air of mystery about them along 
                        with a rich history, not to mention their unique

                        name from the coloration of their coat!

                    <h2>Calico Cat Appearance</h2>

                    <p>
                        Calicoes are often described as the world’s most 
                        colorful cats. After all, they are one of the only cats 
                        to exhibit such a wide range of color variations in 
                        its coat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The calico is not a breed of cat but a domestic cat 
                        with a variety of genetic color variations.
                        The most common calico is a tri-color pattern of orange, 
                        black, and white. It is possible, however, to have a 
                        calico pattern with shades of cream, red, blue-black, 
                        and even chocolate brown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Calicoes with less intense coloration are known as 
                        dilute calico cats. They are primarily white in color 
                        with patches of light color ranging from blue-gray to 
                        cream to strawberry blonde.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can find calico cats across many distinct breeds 
                        with the exception of solid-color and pointed breeds 
                        like the Bombay, Russian Blue, British Shorthair, 
                        Siamese, and Himalayan. Because calico cats occur 
                        across so many different cat breeds, it’s sometimes 
                        hard to tell whether the cat is a calico or actually 
                        a tortoiseshell.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The best way to tell is to examine the calico patches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A tortoiseshell cat usually has the primary colors 
                        (red and black) woven throughout the coat while a 
                        calico will have distinctive solid-colored patches 
                        (like black patches or white patches). Some of the 
                        breeds you can find in calico appearance include 
                        Maine Coon, Manx, Persian, American Shorthair, 
                        Japanese Bobtail, Siberian, and more.

                    <h2>Personality and Behavior</h2>

                    <p>
                        Calico cats aren’t a breed unto themselves, so 
                        we can’t assign breed-specific personality or 
                        behavioral traits to them. Like many cats, calicoes 
                        will develop their unique personalities according to 
                        many factors, such as socialization and life 
                        experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Calico cats aren’t a breed unto themselves, so we can’t 
                        assign breed-specific personality or behavioral 
                        traits to them. Like many cats, calicoes will 
                        develop their unique personalities according to many 
                        factors, such as socialization and life experiences.

                    <p>
                        You could also get the opposite: an aloof, 
                        high-maintenance cat with an attitude. That being said, 
                        many calico owners report that their cats share a 
                        similar personality with tortoiseshell cats – they 
                        called it “tortitude.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Torties are known for being spunky, sassy, and 
                        independent by nature. Calico cats may share these 
                        characteristics but, like we mentioned, you never quite 
                        know what you’re going to get. Plus, calico cats 
                        can’t be bred, so they’re even less likely to share 
                        common characteristics
                    </p>

                    <h2>Mysterious Genetics</h2>

                    <p>
                        The genetics of calico cats are quite fascinating 
                        and have long been the topic of scientific research. 
                        We could really get into the weeds about these 
                        genetics, but your eyes might glaze over. So, we’ll 
                        keep this as short and simple as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The black and orange patches of fur that characterize 
                        these cats are a result of the genetic phenomenon 
                        called “X-chromosome inactivation”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could have a orange tabby with calico patches 
                        of white fur or black fur just as easily as a black cat 
                        with calico patches of white and orange fur.

                    <h2>Are Calico Cats Always Female?</h2>

                    <img 
                        src="images/female calico.jpg"
                        alt="female calico"
                    >

                    <p>
                        In cats, the gene that dictates fur color is located on 
                        the X chromosome. Nearly all calico cats are female, 
                        so they have two X chromosomes. The rare male calico 
                        cats have one X and one Y chromosome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to determining a cat’s coat color, X 
                        chromosomes have numerous genes that code for proteins 
                        that are necessary for survival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With females having two X chromosomes, this double dose 
                        of ‘survival’ genes could be toxic. To compensate 
                        for this double dose, one of the X chromosomes 
                        is randomly inactivated when the calico kitten is just 
                        a tiny ball of cells in the mother’s womb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, if the X chromosome carrying the gene for white 
                        fur in one particular spot of the body is inactivated, 
                        the orange gene might become active in that spot 
                        instead (and vice versa). Because the deactivated 
                        chromosomes are chosen randomly, the combination of 
                        fur colors in calico cats is also random and unique 
                        for every calico 
                        cat.
