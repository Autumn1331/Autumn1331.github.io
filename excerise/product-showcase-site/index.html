                <p>
                    Dr Pepper is a carbonated soft drink. It was created in 
                    the 1880s by pharmacist Charles Alderton in Waco, Texas, 
                    and first served around 1885. Dr Pepper was first 
                    nationally marketed in the United States in 1904. 
                    It is now also sold in Europe, Asia, North and South 
                    America.

                    Dr Pepper is the second most popular soda in the 
                    United States, behind Coca-Cola, and some say it's 
                    the best soda because of its unique flavor, marketing, 
                    and distribution:

                        spicy alternative to cola.
