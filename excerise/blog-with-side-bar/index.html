                <h4>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</h4>
                <p>
                    I love this movie! It’s historical, funny, and 
                    a great story!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always thought this movie was amazing. If 
                    you haven’t seen it, you need to! The artwork/animation 
                    is amazing & it’s got a great storyline. Sure it’s a 
                    kids movie, but what’s wrong with that? Dreamworks really 
                    outdid themselves with this one.
                </p>

                    This film is set in the Wild West before it was settled. 
                    Railroads were still being built! Spirit is a wild 
                    mustang who we see grow up & take charge of his heard. 
                    Sadly, he gets separated by who? Humans. Along the way, 
                    he meets Army men, Native Americans, & his love, Rain. 
                    Rain is a pinto who lives with the natives. I truly love 
                    that they had the narration of Spirit & his thoughts. 
                    They didn’t make him talk, just the humans. Not that 
                    animals talking is bad, I do love Disney! Lol but this 
                    was a nice change & made it feel more realistic.

                <h4>Is Spirit a true story?</h4>

                <h2> Lets get into it</h2>
                <p>
                    Of the many iconic movies DreamWorks has made over the 
                    years, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron has remained a 
                    beloved classic. The film tells the story of a mustang 
                    named Spirit who grows up wild but is captured by 
                    horse wranglers. Spirit develops a relationship with a 
                    Lakota American Indian named Little Creek, and together, 
                    they escape the horse wranglers and attempt to free other 
                    captive horses.

                            helped animators accurately depict horse behavior 
                            and movement.

                    Because of its roots in the Wild West, it may seem like 
                    DreamWorks Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is based on 
                    a true story. It includes various references to American 
                    history, such as the U.S. Calvary's presence in the 
                    American West, the Lakota people and their villages, 
                    and work on the transcontinental railroad. Although 
                    Spirit is an unlikely protagonist in Spirit: Stallion 
                    of the Cimarron, the story is heartfelt and inspiring, 
                    emphasizing ideas of freedom and individuality.

                        Although Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is not 
                        based on a true story, the main character is inspired 
                        by a real horse.</b> The horse, whose real name is 
                        Donner, was born of two wild horses wrangled in Oregon. 
                        Donner is a Kiger Mustang horse, which are known for 
                        their unique coloring and relation to America's first 
                        horses brought from Spain in the 17th century. Donner 
                        is still alive at the age of 28 and living at Return 
                        to Freedom Horse Reserve in central coastal California.

                <p>
                    Donner was integral because the animators had never made 
                    a horse film like Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron before, 
                    so they needed not only inspiration but knowledge. 
                    The DreamWorks team spent several years with Donner, 
                    using him as a resource to understand horse anatomy 
                    and how horses move and behave. In the end, Spirit's 
                    animators were able to use Donner to accurately bring 
                    Spirit, and other horses, to life as animations. Now, 
                    Spirit helps educate regular people on America's mustangs.
