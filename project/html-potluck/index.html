        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <h5>FRENCH TOAST</h5>

            <li>1 brioche loaf, cut into 1/2 to 1-inch thick slices</li>
            <li>3/4 cup half and half</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, to cook the French toast</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>CINNAMON BROWN SUGAR BUTTER</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>FOR SERVING</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>powdered sugar</li>
            <li>maple syrup</li>

        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h5>MAKE THE CINNAMON BUTTER</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the cinnamon butter, combine unsalted butter, 
                cinnamon, salt, brown sugar, and powdered sugar. 
                Mix together until smooth and set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>MAKE THE FRENCH TOAST</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a bowl, make the custard to dip the bread in. 
                Combine half and half, eggs, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, 
                vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon. 
                Whisk really well until completely smooth and homogenous.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little bit of butter. 
                If the pan is too hot, the butter will burn so make sure 
                it's not too high.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dip each brioche slice in the custard quickly and 
                place on the pan. Repeat with a few more until the 
                pan is full but not crowded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook for about 2 minutes, then turn each one over and repeat 
                so every side of the roll gets golden brown and crispy. 
                Take off the pan and repeat with the rest of the bread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a dollop of the cinnamon butter, sprinkle with powdered 
                sugar, and drizzle maple syrup on top to enjoy!
            </li>

            <li>5 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>

            <li>3/4 cup pumpkin puree</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon oil, for brushing the bowl</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>BOILING:</h5>

            <li>8 to 10 cups of water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons malt syrup or molasses</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>EGG WASH:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>EGG WASH:</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h5>PREPARE THE DOUGH:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, salt, 
                brown sugar, pumpkin spice, and cinnamon. Whisk together 
                to ensure the spices are evenly distributed throughout 
                the flour mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate small bowl, dissolve the active dry yeast 
                in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until 
                it becomes foamy and activated.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the center of the flour mixture, create a well and add 
                the pumpkin puree and the yeast mixture. Begin mixing the 
                ingredients together, gradually incorporating the flour 
                into the wet ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the dough starts to come together, transfer it to a 
                lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes. 
                The dough should become smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky 
                to the touch. If it feels too sticky, add a bit more flour, 
                a tablespoon at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly brush a large bowl with oil, then place the dough 
                in the bowl, turning it to coat the surface with oil. 
                Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap 
                and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 
                1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>SHAPING THE BAGELS:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. 
                Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on how large 
                you want your bagels (about 10-12 pieces).
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll each portion into a long rope, about 8-10 inches 
                in length. Then, take the ends of the rope and press them 
                together to form a ring, making sure the ends are securely 
                sealed. Place the shaped bagels on a baking sheet lined 
                with parchment paper and cover them with a towel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them rest for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the 
                boiling water.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>BOILING THE BAGELS:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot, bring 8 to 10 cups of water to a boil. 
                Add the malt syrup or molasses, salt, and baking soda to 
                the boiling water, stirring until dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently lower a few bagels at a time into the boiling water. 
                Boil each bagel for about 1 minute on each side, using a 
                slotted spoon to flip them over. The longer you boil, 
                the chewier the bagels will be. Once boiled, remove the bagels
                from the water and place them back on the parchment-lined 
                baking sheet.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>EGG WASH & BAKING:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 400°F.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and whole milk to 
                create an egg wash. Brush the top of each bagel with 
                the egg wash.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the bagels in the preheated oven for 20-22 minutes, 
                or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when 
                tapped on the bottom.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>COOLING:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Once baked, remove the bagels from the oven and let them 
                cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. 
                Enjoy them plain, toasted, or with your favorite spread!

                In a pot, add water, sugar, vanilla extract, pumpkin puree, 
                unsalted butter, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set over medium-high heat and whisk together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once it comes to a boil, drop the heat to low and add the 
                flour. Use a rubber spatula to mix together until there 
                are no more clumps of flour left, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take off the heat and allow to cool for 6-8 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add one egg and mix using a rubber spatula or in a 
                stand mixer until fully incorporated. Add the second 
                egg and mix again until fully incorporated. The dough 
                should be firm, elastic and just a bit sticky.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer into a piping bag fitted with a tip.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut parchment paper into small squares. Spray with 
                oil and pipe pumpkins out onto each square. You may need 
                to use scissors to cut the stem off at the end.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil to 325°F and drop one heart in at a time, 
                making sure to move slowly so it drops into the oil 
                smoothly. Allow it to get golden brown on one side 
                before flipping over. Once it’s golden on both sides, 
                transfer to a paper towel to drain excess oil. Repeat 
                until all the churros are fried.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat the churros in the cinnamon sugar mixture.
            </li>

                Enjoy with some caramel or chocolate sauce!
